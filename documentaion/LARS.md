The **L**ichtenberg **A**rduno **R**obotic **S**hield is a prototype arduino shield developed in 2021/2022 by Emil Altmann.
It's consists of an arduino prototype shield v.5, servos and sensors.
All connectors use JST XH except for the power connection and every part has its own connector.
Because one goal of the shield is it to make it idiot proof and prevent any electrical misconnection.

#The LARS hat:

In this folder there are the schematic of the Arduino Uno hat as well as some further resources.
The hat can be build with an Arduino Prototype Shield v5 or made as a custom 2 layer PCB.
The PCB files are constructed with the KiCAD software (www.kicad.org), so you have to export the gerber files according to your producer.

###The servos:
The servos are MG955 RC servos modified to run on more than 5v.
Where the positional servos are able to rotate 270Â° and are equipped with an 3 pin JST-XH connector.
Moreover the free running servos are configured with an 5 pin JST-XH of which the interrupt pin can be used for further sensors or as I did broken out into a DuPont style female header.

The pinout is:
pin 1 <-> pwm
pin 2 <-> VIN
pin 3 <-> GND
pin 4 <-> +5v
pin 5 <-> interrupt IN

###The ultrasonic modules:
The ultrasonic module wired to a JST-XH 4 pin connector.
A tip for strengthening the solder joints of wires to PCBs, you can use gel super glue moreover you can use it too to prevent the ribbon cables of splitting apart.

The pinout is:
pin 1 <-> +5v
pin 2 <-> Trig
pin 3 <-> Echo
pin 4 <-> GND

###The switches:
The switches use a 2 pin JST-XH connector.
